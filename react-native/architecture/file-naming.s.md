# [Standard] File Naming

## Checks

- File names use [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
- Component file names use the component name
- When containers are next to their component
  - The component name should be `<ComponentClassName>.component.js`
  - The container name should be `<ComponentClassName>.container.js`
